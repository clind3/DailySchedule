# Daily Schedule

## Description

Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## Installation

Download SSH key or HTTPS link provided in GitHub and open project index.html file then run html file provided.

## Usage
```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours that ar color coded to indicate whether if is in the past, present, or future.
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


```

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
